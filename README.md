# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine learning
Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in today’s society.
The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in BC pattern classification and forecast modelling.

Classification and data mining methods are an effective way to classify data. Especially in medical field, where those methods are widely used in diagnosis and analysis to make decisions.

Sklearn also provides many datasets that can be used for training purposes. To see how we can use machine learning for cancer diagnosis, we will be using Sklearn’s Breast Cancer Wisconsin Database which contains features and targets of 569 samples with 30 features.

We will use the UCI Machine Learning Repository for breast cancer dataset.

In order to make more advancements in this field of study, we can try and focus on applying unsupervisedlearning as well, and also use image classification and regression techniques to make our models more expert in detecting the malignancy. ML has still a long way to go if we are talking about completely replacing diagnostic tests like PET SCAN and biopsies. However, if successful, the detection will be very accurate and painless.
